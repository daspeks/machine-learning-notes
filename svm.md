# SVM :rocket:

* SVMs are used for 
    * classification (linear and non linear)
    * regression
    * outlier detection
* An SVM classifier works by drawing a line (**decision boundary**) that stays far away from the training examples.
* An SVM classifier fits the widest possible *street* between linearly separable classes. This is called **large margin classification**.
* An SVM classifier is only affected by examples located on the edge of the street. Adding more examples off the street is not going to affect the decision boundary. The examples on the edge of the street are called **support vectors**.
* SVMs are sensitive to feature scaling; the classifier provides a better decision boundary with feature scaling.
